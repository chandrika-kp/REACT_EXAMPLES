Counter: Build a Simple React Component

Create a React component called Counter that displays a counter and provides two buttons: one for incrementing the counter and another for decrementing it. The initial value of the counter should be 0.

The component should have the following features:

Display the current count.
Provide a button labeled "Increment" that increases the count by 1 when clicked.
Provide a button labeled "Decrement" that decreases the count by 1 when clicked.
Ensure that the count cannot go below 0.
Additionally, include a brief explanation or comments in your code to describe how your component works.

This question assesses the candidate's understanding of basic React concepts such as component creation, state management, event handling, and conditional rendering. Candidates are expected to demonstrate their ability to set up a React component, manage state, and handle user interactions.

Todo List: Implement a ToDo List

Create a React application that allows users to manage a simple ToDo list. The application should have the following features:

Display a list of ToDo items.
Provide an input field for adding new ToDo items.
Allow users to mark a ToDo item as completed.
Allow users to delete a ToDo item.
Your solution should consist of displaying the ToDo list and managing the state and actions (adding, completing, and deleting ToDo items). Use React hooks for state management.
