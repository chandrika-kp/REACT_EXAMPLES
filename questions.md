Counter: Build a Simple React Component

Create a React component called Counter that displays a counter and provides two buttons: one for incrementing the counter and another for decrementing it. The initial value of the counter should be 0.

The component should have the following features:

Display the current count.
Provide a button labeled "Increment" that increases the count by 1 when clicked.
Provide a button labeled "Decrement" that decreases the count by 1 when clicked.
Ensure that the count cannot go below 0.
Additionally, include a brief explanation or comments in your code to describe how your component works.

This question assesses the candidate's understanding of basic React concepts such as component creation, state management, event handling, and conditional rendering. Candidates are expected to demonstrate their ability to set up a React component, manage state, and handle user interactions.

Todo List: Implement a ToDo List

Create a React application that allows users to manage a simple ToDo list. The application should have the following features:

Display a list of ToDo items.
Provide an input field for adding new ToDo items.
Allow users to mark a ToDo item as completed.
Allow users to delete a ToDo item.
Your solution should consist of displaying the ToDo list and managing the state and actions (adding, completing, and deleting ToDo items). Use React hooks for state management.

Question: Create a Dynamic Form

Build a React component that renders a dynamic form. The form should allow users to add and remove input fields dynamically. Each input field should consist of a text input and a corresponding "Remove" button. Users should be able to add as many input fields as needed and remove them individually.

Your solution should include the following features:

1.A button labeled "Add Field" that, when clicked, adds a new text input field and a "Remove" button beside it.
2.The ability to add and remove input fields dynamically.
3.A function or mechanism to retrieve the values of all input fields when needed.
Ensure that your code is clean, modular, and well-commented. Consider using React hooks for state management.

This question assesses the candidate's understanding of dynamic forms, state management, and event handling in React. It also tests the ability to create components that can handle variable numbers of input fields.
