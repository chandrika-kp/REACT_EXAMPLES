----------------------------------------------
## Run paricular React Example

I have a React project where each component in the components folder represents a different example, and you want to run a particular component, you can follow these steps:

Open the App.js file in your project. This file likely contains the main structure of your React application.

Uncomment both the particular component and the import statements at the top of App.js where components are imported.
